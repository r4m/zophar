Zophar
=====

This application allows to distributedly identify the parameters of a wireless channel in a network of Tmote Sky (telosb) sensors. The identification is run through a symmetric gossip consensus algorithm Zophar is provided with a laptop Java application that lets to visualize and save in real-time the states of sensors and to compute the identification locally.

This project was originally hosted at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zophar/).
